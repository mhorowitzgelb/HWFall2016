<h1>Numerical Biology 606: Homework II</h1>

<h3>Part 1: Using Python to Explore a Protein Hinge</h3>

In this exercise we will be working with the calmodulin structure from the PDB entry 4CLN.
The structure of calmodulin consists of two small globular domains connected by an alpha helix.
Both domains can bind up to two calcium ions each.
The presence or absence of bound calcium will influence the flexibility of calmodulin and thereby
modulate the binding of calmodulin to other proteins.
In this manner, eukaryotic cells use calmodulin to regulate the behavior of various other proteins to which it can bind.
Read more about calmodulin at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calmodulin" target="calw"> Wikipedia</a>.
Also, check out the calmodulin entry
at Proteopedia: <a href="http://www.proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Calmodulin" target="calp"> check it out!</a>.
</p><p>

A Python program called <code>simplehinge.py</code> is provided.
This program uses a very simple model to simulate the interaction of the two domains during
the hinge motion in the connecting helix.  By rotating about a Phi angle of a single specified
residue in the hinge region, a series of conformations is generated.  Each conformation,
is written to a single PDB file using the <code>MODEL</code> and <code>ENDMDL</code> PDB key words
to separate each conformation.  This PDB file may then be read by PyMol to visualize the series of models
as a movie. This program is intended to extensively demonstrate the use of the <code>PDButils</code>
module for reading and writing PDB files, and to provide an example of how to use the information stored in the
various data structures defined by this module.
</p>
<p>
To run this program you must provide four pieces of information on the command line:
<pre>
   python simplehinge.py  "pdb_file_name"  "residue_number_to_rotate_phi"  "AngleDegreesStepSize" "IncludHetAtms"
</pre>

For example, using molecule 4cln.pdb, rotate about the Phi dihedral angle of residue 77 by increments of
20 degrees and include heteroatoms in the output:
<pre>
   python simplehinge.py 4cln.pdb 77 20. T
</pre>
Or on Canopy, you will use the command:
<pre>
  %run simplehinge.py 4cln.pdb 77 20. T
</pre>

All of the residues after specified residue number will be rotated and all the residues before
that residue will be left unchanged. You can also select which HETATM, to leave fixed or to rotate,
but this feature is hardwired into the code. (see code)
</p>

<h3>Homework Assignment (Hinge):</h3>
Your assignment is to run this program three times with different selections of the <code>residue_number_to_rotate_phi</code>
input parameter.  For each run the program will write out a uniquely named PDB file containing all the models generated.
You should view these files with <code>PyMol</code> and, to highlight the location of the calcium ions, you can
<pre>
@calmod_calciums.pml
</pre>
in the <code>PyMol</code> command entry window.
</p>
<p>
You <b>must</b> use residue number 77 as one of your choices and 
pick two other positions on the helix, one on each side of this. Use a step size of 15. The program may take a few minutes to run since there
is a significant number of inter-atomic distance calculations that must be made to generate the inter-domain
interactions. 

You should keep <code>IncludHetAtms</code> flag set to <code>T</code> for all runs.
After you have completed all three cases and examined the movies with <code>PyMol</code>, you will be ready for the
main part of the homework assignment.
</p><p>

When you ran <code>simplehinge.py</code>, besides the PDB file, another file was automatically generated.
This additional file contains the inter-domain interaction data which you are required to plot.
Your assignment is to write a <b>Python program</b> to read in the interaction data files for residue 77 and the other residues you chose (with step size 15) and
generate two graphs using <b><code>matplotlib</code></b>.

One graph should compare the Coulomb repulsion terms for the three residues you chose, and the other should plot the number of atoms
within the collision cut off, both as a function of rotation angle.
The first data column in the txt files gives the rotation angle, use this as your
x-axis for both graphs.
The second column gives the calcium ion Coulomb term.  Use this as the y-axis in the first graph.
For the second graph use the last column (nltcut) for the y-axis.  
It would be good to plot the data points as symbols and draw a smooth
curve through them.  Feel free to explore plotting options with matplotlib.
</p>

The file plot.py outlines the skeleton for the code required to generate the graphs. You will need to complete 3 sections of code in this file to make it work correctly

<p>The Matplotlib home page may serve as a useful reference: <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/" target="mplt"> (Visit)</a></p>
</p>

<h3>Deliverable (Hinge):</h3>
You should save a copy of the graphs (preferably saved as .png files), the .txt file containing the data
used to create the graphs, and a completed copy of the Python program you wrote to generate the graphs.  Please do
not submit any PDB files.  All the required files should be combined into a single archive file using
either <code>zip</code> or <code>tar</code>.  The archive file should then be uploaded into the <b>Homework 2</b>
<b>Dropbox Folder</b> on the <b>Learn@UW</b> page for this class.   
<p>
</p>

<h3>Part 2: Fourier Correlation Docking</h3>

In this exercise your assignment is to write a two-dimensional docking program
using Fourier correlation methods.
You are provided with two Python programs.  The first program will help you understand
the basic formalism of this method and is used to graphically display the various functions
needed in this approach. The core of this program is basically a re-write in Python of the Matlab program
presented in last Friday's lecture (October 8th). The second program demonstrates how you can caluculate the energy
of interaction between two molecules using Equation 5.7 on page 73 of the course textbook.
These programs should provide you with the basic building blocks for completing this assignment.

Before describing more details regarding the assignment, you should test drive these
programs and gain some understanding of how these programs work.

<h3>Description of first program: <code>fouriercorr.py</code> </h3>

To begin, try running the first program with the following input:
<pre>
    python fouriercorr.py
</pre>
<p>
So you should see a list of the command line arguments.  There are many, so pay close attention to
what they do.
</p>
<p>
The first command line parameter is used to select one of the program's built-in models:
<pre>
    model=1 :  dipeptide contining THR 1 and THR 2 from PDB 1crn, used in demo last week (not centered)
    model=2 :  two Ca++ ions 4 Angstroms apart, vertical with midpoint at origin
    model=3 :  one Ca++ ion and one O-- ion 4 Angstroms apart, vertical with midpoint at origin, Ca on top
    model=4 :  two O-- ions 4 Angstroms apart, vertical with midpoint at origin
    model=5 :  two Ca++ ions 4 Angstroms apart, horizontal with midpoint at origin
    model=6 :  one Ca++ ion and one O-- ion 4 Angstroms apart, horizontal with midpoint at origin, Ca on right
    model=7 :  two O-- ions 4 Angstroms apart,  horizontal with midpoint at origin
    model=8 :  single amino acid, GLU 23 from PDB 1crn, centered on CD, carboxylate carbon
    model=9 :  single aminp acid, ARG 10 from PDB 1crn, centered on CZ, guanidinium carbon
    model=10:  single Ca++ ion at origin
    model=11:  single O-- ion at origin
    model=12:  three Ca++ ions in an L shape configuration (a simple chiral molecule)
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The next three parameters define the potential energy function.<br>
Here is the actual code to help you see what these three do:
<pre>
    if efunc == 1:
    g = alpha / (r+eps)
    elec = True
    
    elif efunc == 2:
    g = numpy.exp(-alpha*r) / (r + eps)
    elec = True
    
    elif efunc == 3:
    r6term = (alpha/r+eps)**6
    g = 2.* r6term * ( r6term - 2)
    
    igg = 0
    for gg in g:
    iv = 0
    for v in gg:
    #print igg,iv, g[igg,iv]
    if v > 10.0:
    g[igg,iv] = 10.0
    iv += 1
    igg += 1
    elec = False
</pre>
As an example, if you use <code>2 1. .01</code> for arguments 2 through 4, you
would select the second function using alpha as <code>1.</code> and eps as <code>.01</code>.
</p>
<p>
The next three parameters after the three for the potential energy function,
define the grid to be used for the 2D FFTs. Using <code>-10 10 .5</code>
gives a square grid ranging from <code>-10</code> to <code>10</code> in steps of <code>0.5</code>.
</p>
<p>
The very last parameter lets you pick one of the three available plotting options.  Plot option 1
gives 3D surface plots and will take more time to run for large grids than the other two. Plot option 3
is probably the most useful for trying to interpret locations for various features - you can use the
tool with the magnifying glass to pull a rectangle around a region of intereset for closer inspection.
Clicking the Home icon resets the plot.
</p>
<p>
Now try:
<pre>
    python fouriercorr.py 8 2 1. .01 -10 10 .5 3
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Next try:
<pre>
    python fouriercorr.py 8 3 3. .5 -10 10 .5 3
</pre>
<p>
Note that you can display more than one on the screen at a time.  This is often useful when
trying to examine how changing parameters affects the function.  One way to do this is to open multiple
terminal windows and run one from each.  Note that you must click on the top-left, red button
to terminate the Python script.
</p>
<p>
Try some different parameters on your own and see how things work.  Read carefully the "Fourier Correlation Docking"
section in Chapter 5 and try to indentify the various transforms from the equations.
</p>

<h3>Description of second program: <code>fouriercorr_energy.py</code> </h3>
The second program has exactly the same input parameters as the first program except there is
one additional parameter at the end.  This last parameter specifies the a second model for calculating the
energy function.
To begin, try running the first program with the following input:
<pre>
    python fouriercorr_energy.py
</pre>
Cut and paste the two examples from the help page.
Note that the plots represent the interaction energy for all locations within the specified grid.
The best "docking" positions are the ones with the lowest energy, which should be negative.
Try using some of the very simple
single, double, or triple ions models to see if the lowest energy points make sense.
<p>
<h4>Pre-Homework Problem</h4>
Look through the source code <code>fouriercorr_energy.py</code> and locate the the section
that reads as:
<pre>
    ########################################################################################
    #  HOMEWORK QUESTION 1: DETERMINE THE CORRECT CORRELATION FUNCTION:
    ########################################################################################
    
    # SHOULD "firstfnx" be set to True of False?
    
    firstfnx = False
    firstfnx = True
    
    if firstfnx:
    fft2E = fft2fB*numpy.conj(fft2fgA)
    else:
    fft2E = numpy.conj(fft2fB)*fft2fgA
    
    ########################################################################################
    ########################################################################################
</pre>
Recall that determining a correlation function is slightly different than the convolution in that
you must take the complex conjugate of one of the functions within the pair.  Which one?  You can
"experimentally" determine the correct one by using a chiral molecule and see if the proper hand is preserved
in the locations of the energy function minima.  Recall that the model 12 provides a simple example of a chiral molecule.
Use an oppositely charged diatomic model and test the two cases to discover the correct definition of <code>fft2E</code>.
<p>
Write a short paragraph explaining your findings.
</p>
<h4>Pre-Homework Problem</h4>
Nearby in the source code of <code>fouriercorr_energy.py</code> you'll find:
<pre>
    ########################################################################################
    #  HOMEWORK QUESTION 2: WHEN SHOULD WE APPLY THE FOLLOWING SHIFT TRANSFORMATIONS?
    #  WHEN SHOULD WE NOT APPLY THE SHIFT TRANSFORMATIONS?
    ########################################################################################
    
    #fft2f = numpy.fft.fftshift(fft2f)
    #fft2g = numpy.fft.fftshift(fft2g)
    #fft2fg = numpy.fft.fftshift(fft2fg)
    #ifftfg = numpy.fft.fftshift(ifftfg)
</pre>
When working with FFT's it is easy to get confused about when the transform should be shifted or not.
Maybe <code>Google</code> about this problem, and see if you can learn what it's all about.  Then, try
removing the comments and run some of more "experiments" to observe what happens.  A good test case is to use
Model 8 for the fixed molecule and Model 10 as a moving probe to find where the calcium ion "sticks" to glutamic acid.
You should notice something wrong when the wrong choice is made.
<p>
Write a short paragraph explaining your findings.
</p>
<h3>Homework (Fourier)</h3>
Now that you have gained some familiarity with the key concepts of Fourier correlation docking,
you are ready for the main homework assignment.  There are two key issues which you will be asked
to address by building a new Python program, using and modifying sections of code from <code>fouriercorr_energy.py</code>.
<p>
</p>
The first issue is that only the translational search is made with the current version of <code>fouriercorr_energy.py</code>.
You should write additional code to rotate a chosen moving model into new orientations, keeping the same center, and run the
translational search for each orientation.  You are not expected to sample rotation space using a fine rotation step size, something
like 45 degrees is good enough for demonstration.
</p>
<p>
The second issue involves modifying the program to avoid finding energy minima which involve overlapping atoms between the
two molecules.  Recall that the single calcium ion stuck directly on to the glutamic acid oxygens when using the point charge
forces (1 or 2).  To avoid this problem you must build in steric repulsion by adding energy function 3 to the total energy.  Recall or revisit
the two demos you first ran for <code>fouriercorr_energy.py</code>.  By combining these two functions you should try to remove
the false minima observed when using only the point charge models.
</p>
<p>
Once both of these upgrades have been made, try to see if your program can locate the
salt-bridge between glutamic acid (8) and arginine (9).
</p>

<h3>Deliverable (Fourier):</h3>
Please include a short write-up including your answers to the two mini-questions and a brief description of
of how you implemented the Main Homework Problem.  Mention which test cases you used and include any other comments
or observations relevant to your program which you'd like to make.
Any legible format is acceptable for this, yes, even a text file.  Also include your final Python program.
<p>
</p>
Combine the two files into a single archive file using
either <code>zip</code> or <code>tar</code>.  The archive file should then be uploaded into the <b>Homework 2</b>
<b>Dropbox Folder</b> on the <b>Learn@UW</b> page for this class.
<p>
<h3>Note about Screen size adjustment</code> </h3>
The size of the graphics window is set inside the program with the code:
<pre>
    #bigscreen = False  # For most Laptops
    bigscreen = True   # For Imacs and comparable sized displays
</pre>
You should adjust this for the computer you are using if necessary.
</p>
<p>
If the built-in settings toggled with the above switch do not produce a desired result,
you will have to tweak another section of code:
<pre>
    #
    # Overall size of figure, adjust for your screen:
    #
    if bigscreen:
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(18.,6.6))
    else:
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(15.,7.8))
</pre>
Try to select a ratio so that the plots remain more or less square.
