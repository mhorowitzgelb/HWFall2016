The correct choice is to fftshift the ifftfg grid since you never shift in fourier space as it will generate complete
nonsense. Shifting fft2fg generates nonsense in the results. Shifting fft2g generates nonsense, but it is not used in
later calculations so it is not visualized. Shifting fft2f surprisingly does not result in visual nonsense since
apparently a shifted Dirac delta function in fourier space results in the exact same function.
