<h2>Using Gradient Descent to Determine the Energy Minima of Two Interacting Molecules</h2>
<p>
With the two-dimensional molecular models from the previous Homework 3, you will
use the Gradient Descent minimization method to find minima in the interaction
energy function between two molecules.  The Python program included, <code>energyAB2.py</code>,
will provide you with the basis for visualizing your results. To see examples of how to
use this program, run the program without any command line arguments and read the resulting message:
<pre>
python energyAB2.py
</pre>
Note that this program allows you to fine-tune the Van der Waals potential (6-12) parameters.
These can be important for getting clear minima in the energy function,
 and before running your Gradient Descent program, you should
use this program to select a good set of parameters for a given model pair.
</p>
<p>
You should review the lecture notes describing the Gradient Descent method in Section 7.2.
</p>

<h3>Simple Intro to Gradient Descent</h3>
<p>
Based on a Python program from
the Wikipedia page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent" target="gdwik">Gradient Descent</a>,
the following code will help you understand this method:
<pre>
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# BASED ON CODE FROM: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent
#
#   f(x)=x**4-3*x**3+2 , with derivative f'(x)=4*x**3-9*x**2

import sys

if len(sys.argv) > 1:
   alpha = float(sys.argv[1])
else:
   # default step size
   alpha = 0.01

# From calculation, we expect that the local minimum occurs at x=9/4

xOld = 0
xNew = 6 # The algorithm starts at x=6

precision = 0.00001
 
def f_prime(x):
    return 4 * x**3 - 9 * x**2
 
istep = 0
while abs(xNew - xOld) > precision:
    xOld = xNew
    grad = f_prime(xNew)
    xNew = xOld - alpha * grad
    istep += 1
    print istep, "xOld,xNew,grad:", xOld,xNew,grad

print("Local minimum occurs at ", xNew)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

<h3>Exercise: A Simple one-D Gradient Descent</h3>
The above program allows you to specify a value for alpha on the command line.
Note that this alpha is the step size in the Gradient Descent and has nothing directly to do with
what we called alpha in the potential functions in the FFT programs.
Either find the file <code>simple_gradient_descent.py</code> included with the homework download
or cut and paste this code into a file and try running it:
<pre>
python simple_gradient_descent.py 0.01
</pre>
Now try some different alphas, say 0.001, 0.015, and  0.02.
What do these results tell you about the importance of alpha?
</p>

<h3>Main Homework Problem</h3>
<p>
In the previous Homework 3 assignment you generated <emp>maps</em> of the 2D energy landscape for two
interacting molecules using FFT methods.  The program provided, <code>energyAB2.py</code>, allows
you to visualize this landscape and also determines the global energy minimum and marks them in
the figure.   Additionally, this program will write out transformed versions of the PDB file when
the amino acid test models 8 and 9 (or their side chain only versions, 18 and 19) are used.  This allows
you to directly look at the configurations of the molecules in the observed minimum energy location.
In addition, this program calculates the energy minimum using the discrete sum forms of the energy function
and compares this minimum to the FFT minimum energy location.
</p>
<p>
In this homework assignment you will use the same model systems
and energy functions as before, but instead of using FFTs,
you will use direct evaluation of the energy function and its derivatives in order to implement
the Gradient Descent method.  Using pieces of the program provided, <code>energyAB2.py</code>,
you will see how the energy is directly calculated from the summation over all atom pairs between the
two molecules.  In addition to the energy function itself, you will need to calculate the first-order derivatives
of the energy function.  Once you have written these functions, you will be ready to set-up the Gradient Descent
program.
</p>
<p>
Your program should allow you to enter a starting x,y position to begin the search and also an
alpha value (step size).  After you determine a minimum configuration for
a given test pair, use <code>energyAB2.py</code> to view the
location of your minimum and see if it is consistent with the landscape.  You should make a minor
modification to <code>energyAB2.py</code> to read-in the location
of your minimum and mark it on the plot. (The code already
does this sort of mark-up for the FFT minimum so this should be relatively easy.)
</p>
<p>
It would also be worthwhile to record the trajectory of the minimization steps
and plot the path on the landscape plot, though this is not required. This would be a useful aid
in selecting a good alpha (step size) and might end up saving you time.  An alternative would be to use your
plotting skills from Homework 2 to plot these convergence (or non-convergence) paths directly from your
Gradient Descent program.  By doing a side-by-side comparison of this simpler plot with the landscape plot
you can judge whether or not the path truly converges toward the nearest minimum.
</p>
<p>
Hand in your code and for the write-up, give a list of some of the molecule pairs you tested with a brief
description of what you concluded from each test pair.  For each test you report, provide all the input parameters
so that your program can be re-run by someone else in order to re-generate the results.
