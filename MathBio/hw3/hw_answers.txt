Exercise Simple Gradient Descent:
When setting the alpha value, if it is set too high it will overshoot the global
minimum and get stuck at a plateau to  the left.

Test Examples,

1.

Molecule 19, ran through with 18

input
python hw3.py 19 0.75 0.1 18 -1 -4 0.0001

Finds a Energy level of about -59. This is about the same as what the discrete min method
finds with a grid step size of 0.5.  Both methods find minimums in close proximity to each other.

2.


Molecule 9, ran through with 11

input
python hw3.py  9 0.75 0.001 11 -1.1 -2.5 0.0001

Finds an Energy level of about -147 near the discrete min. But minimum found is actually slightly
greater than the energy found by the discrete min method. The FFT method found a different location with lower
energy of -188.

3.

Molecule 12, ran through with 18

input
python hw3.py  12 0.75 0.001 18 2.3 -2.3 0.0001

The gradient descent method found a minimum of about -471. This is much better than the discrete min method which found
only a minimum of around -459. The minimum found by gradient descent was close to the one found by the discrete min
method but not anywhere near as close as in examples 1 and 2.
