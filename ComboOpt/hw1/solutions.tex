\textbf{Lemma A:}

\textbf{Statement:} A connected subgraph of $n$ nodes requires at least $n-1$ edges.

\textbf{Proof:} Consider a graph $G = (V,E)$. 

Let $G_n$ be the set of all connected subgraphs of $G$ with $n$ nodes. And let $G'_n$ be a subgraph of $G_n$ such that the number of edges in $G'_n$ is minimized. Then let $E'_n = E(G'_n)$ and $V'_n = V(G'_n)$.

First we shall consider the base case of $n = 1$ nodes. Here it is trivial to see by definition of a graph that $E'_1 = 0$. 

Now assume that $E'_b = \alpha$. Then it must be true that $E'_{b+1} \geq \alpha + 1$ since for any subgraph in $G_b$, by definition of a graph, requires at least one new edge to connect a new node.

Therefore $E'_n \geq n+1$, hence proving our statement.
