\textbf{Lemma A:}

\textbf{Statement:} A connected subgraph of $n$ nodes requires at least $n-1$ edges.

\textbf{Proof:} Consider a graph $G = (V,E)$. 

Let $G_n$ be the set of all connected subgraphs of $G$ with $n$ nodes. And let $G'_n$ be a subgraph of $G_n$ such that the number of edges in $G'_n$ is minimized. Then let $E'_n = E(G'_n)$ and $V'_n = V(G'_n)$.

First we shall consider the base case of $n = 1$ nodes. Here it is trivial to see by definition of a graph that $E'_1 = 0$. 

Now assume that $E'_b = \alpha$. Then it must be true that $E'_{b+1} \geq \alpha + 1$ since for any subgraph in $G_b$, by definition of a graph, requires at least one new edge to connect a new node.

Therefore $E'_n \geq n+1$, hence proving our statement.

\textbf{Lemma B:}

\textbf{Statement:}
For a spanning tree $H$, there exists a node $v$ such that $v \in H$ and $v$ has a degree of $1$

\textbf{Proof:} Clearly no node can have a degree of $0$ or else H would not be connected and therefore not be a tree. So then it is suffice to show that if all nodes in $H$ have a degree greater than $1$, then that implies that $H$ has a cycle and therefore is not a tree. 

To show this, consider a simple traversal algorithm. In this algorithm one starts at an arbitrary node in $H$ and then traverses an unused edge until it can no longer move because it is stuck at a node with all used edges. If at any point in this algorithm it hits a node already visited then there must be a cycle in the graph since it would imply that there is a path using unique edges from a node back to itself. If this algorithm were run on $H$ it would have to hit a node a second time. This is because for the algorithm to not find a cycle it would have to never hit a node twice and then stop at a final unvisited node because it was stuck. But it can't get stuck at such a node since the degree of all nodes is greater than $1$. Therefore there must exist a node in $H$ such that its degree is $1$.

\textbf{Lemma C:} 

\textbf{Statement:} If $H$ is a tree with at least $2$ nodes then there exists a node $v$ such that $v \in H$, $H \backslash v$ is a tree and $|E(H)| = |E(H \backslash v)| + 1$ 

\textbf{Proof:} By Lemma B there must be a node $v \in H$ with a degree of $1$. $H$ is a tree and therefore has no cycles so $H \backslash v$ has no cycles either. And since $v$ has a degree of $1$, by definition there can be no path in $H$ between any two nodes in $H \backslash v$ that can include the node $v$. Then since $H$ is connected, by definition $H \backslash v$ is connected. Therefore since $H \backslash v$ is connected and has no cycles it is also a tree. And since $v$ has a degree of $1$, then clearly $|E(H)| = |E(H \backslash v)| + 1$.

\textbf{Lemma 2.2}

\textbf{Statement:} Let $G$ be a connected graph with $n$ nodes. Then $G$ is a spanning tree if and only if it has exactly $n-1$ nodes.

\textbf{Proof:} 
First we shall prove that if $G$ is a spanning tree then it has 1 less edges than nodes.

Let $S_n$ be the set of all spanning trees of all subgraphs of $G$ containing $n$ nodes where a spanning tree is possible. Then let $|E_n|$ be the number of edges of used for each subgraph in $S_n$ assuming they are all the same. 

Clearly $|E_1| = 0$ by definition of a graph.

Then if $S_n = n-1$ then $S_{n+1} = n $. 
This is because Lemma C implies for all $H \in S_{n+1}$ there exists a node $v \in H$ such that $H \backslash v \in S_{n}$ and as well $|E_{n+1}| = |E_{n}| + 1$. 

Therefore by induction $G$ is a spanning tree of $n$ nodes then it contains $n-1$ edges.

Now we shall show that if $G$ is a connected graph with $n$ nodes and $n-1$ edges then it is a tree. 

If $G$ were connected and not a tree then it must have a cycle. If it had a cycle then there must be an edge $e = (u,v)$ such that there is a path without $e$ from $u$ to $v$ and clearly $e$ can be removed from $G$ without breaking the connectivity of $G$. But this would imply that there is a connected graph with $n-2$ edges and $n$ nodes with breaks Lemma A. Therefore $G$ cannot have any cycles and must be a tree.

\textbf{Statement}: Let $H = (V,T)$ be a spanning tree of $G = (V,E)$. Let $e = vw$ be an edge in $E \backslash T$, and let $f$ be en edge of a simple path in H from $v$ to $w$. Then (a) the subgraph $H'$ obtained from adding $e$ has a unique cycle containing $e$, and (b)
